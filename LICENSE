ADDITIONAL NOTICES:

1. AI-Generated Code: This project was created with the assistance of AI 
   (Google Gemini). While efforts have been made to ensure functionality 
   and security, users should review the code and use at their own risk.

2. Face Recognition Disclaimer: Face recognition technology is not as secure 
   as password-based authentication. This software should be used for 
   convenience only, not as a primary security measure. Always maintain 
   password-based authentication as a fallback.

3. No Security Guarantees: The authors and contributors make no guarantees 
   about the security of this software. Users are responsible for their own 
   security practices and should not rely solely on face recognition for 
   authentication.

4. Third-Party Dependencies: This software uses third-party libraries 
   (face_recognition, dlib, OpenCV, etc.) which are subject to their own 
   licenses and terms.
